/*Description:
 * This is a working and full featured Google Rank Checker
 * Tis script can and should be use as a base for own developments and customizations but it is also useful as standalone tool
 * Knowing your website rank for important keywords and watching how it changes related to website changes or competition is essential, this tool can be a great help on that.
 * There are websites that might do the same for you but they are unreliable and often produce wrong results, this tool puts that power into your own hands.
 * Traffic estimation: 450kb per 100 results
 *Features:
 *  + seo-proxies.com API support - getting reliable results from Google can be a pain and most proxies are not well suited for this, seo-proxies makes it easy
 *  + local country result feature (default is the main english google result set) (read more in last notes)
 *  + multipage DOM parsing - this tool is an advanced project, it can test for more than one result page and will interpret the results like a real browser (DOM)
 *  + correct proxy management - built in IP management, the tool will use and manage IPs in an optimal way to avoid blocks, wrong results and similar issues
 *  + multi-keyword support - test for more than one keyword
 *  + local cache (file based) to prevent unrequired serp lookups (resolution is one lookup per keyword-page per day)
 *Requirements:
 *  + local write rights to create the working directory and store files in it (script will create directory and files automated)
 *  + Remove timeout for console scripts (when run on console)
 *  + Based on usage consider increasing max memory for console scripts (when run on console)
 *
 *Possible upgrades and ideas:
 *  + Multi-threading support can easily be added. delay_time() and the proxy API need adaption (&offset=n) for custom seo-proxies licenses with parallel proxy support.
 *  + Database support for ranking results is recommended for professional usage, this would easily allow a ranking history.
 *  + When used in production environments, emailing support should be added so any warnings or aborts result in an emergency email to the project manager
 *  
 *
 *Last notes: 
 * DONATE if you like the source or information so I can keep working and updating.
 * The recommended source of IPs is the built in seo-proxies.com service. It is of course possible to modify the source code and change the proxy support.
 * But this can result in accuracy/gray+blocklist troubles and even legal issues with Google, it is not recommended to change the proxy source or the IP management functions without advanced scraping experience.
 * From time to time Google changes parts of the design, sometimes this can cause parsing issues. The website will try to always stay up to date on such changes.
 *
 * In general it is not recommended to use 100 results per page, this will reduce the amount of proxies required (in best case by 10) but also reduce the 
 * accuracy of the ranking results. It is required to use the '10 results per page' option if ranking results shall be accurate.
 *
 * The country specific results have been verified using geolocated IP addresses and browsers for UK, USA, DE and AT.
 * In this project I'm using the small "google api" from seo-proxies to retrieve country codes and google domains.
 * In my tests it has been found that the Rank checker is able to produce IDENTICAL ranking results when using my seo-proxies.com license.
 * So it is possible to test for local results WITHOUT maintaining expensive proxies or servers in each of the countries.
 * However, I can't guarantee this for all results. But this was true for resultset I've personally tested.
 *
 *
 * The cache files contain a serialized php array. The main reason for this is that Google changes their layout from time to time, storing the raw html content
 * in cache files would require to keep all "old" processing methods to be able to parse the output at a later time.
 * The cache can be cleared by a crontab/scheduler which removes files older than 24 hours (based on unix "find" for example)
 *
