Open source code
================
To help getting started we provide source code. We currently provide PHP code, more languages will follow. However, even as a non PHP developer the code will show how to implement our API correctly. All you need to do to start scraping automated is to download the examples, define 'priority' and login credentials and supply keywords.

## PHP
Our PHP source code consists of one class 'ApiSCSE.php' to be included into your PHP project. By using this code it's essentially possible to scrape thousands of keywords with just a few lines of code. You can watch this source code running within a video on our website.

Download the API and examples as [ZIP archive](/source_code/php/php.zip).

## Python
